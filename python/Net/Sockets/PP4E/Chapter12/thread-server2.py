"""
Server side: open a socket on a port, listen for a message from a client,
and send an echo reply; echoes lines until eof when client closes socket;
spawns a thread to handle each client connection; threads share global
memory space with main thread; this is more portable than fork: threads
work on standard Windows systems, but process forks do not;
