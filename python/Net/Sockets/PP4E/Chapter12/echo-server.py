Server side: open a TCP/IP socket on a port, listen for a message from
a client, and send an echo reply; this is a simple one-shot listen/reply
conversation per client, but it goes into an infinite loop to listen for
more clients as long as this server script runs; the client may run on
a remote machine, or on same computer if it uses 'localhost' for server
