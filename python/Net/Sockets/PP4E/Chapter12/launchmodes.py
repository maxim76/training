launch Python programs with command lines and reusable launcher scheme classes;
auto inserts "python" and/or path to Python executable at front of command line;
some of this module may assume 'python' is on your system path (see Launcher.py);
subprocess module would work too, but os.popen() uses it internally, and the goal
is to start a program running independently here, not to connect to its streams;
multiprocessing module also is an option, but this is command-lines, not functions:
doesn't make sense to start a process which would just do one of the options here;
new in this edition: runs script filename path through normpath() to change any
/ to \ for Windows tools where required; fix is inherited by PyEdit and others;
on Windows, / is generally allowed for file opens, but not by all launcher tools;
