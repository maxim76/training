"""
Server side: open a socket on a port, listen for a message from a client, and
send an echo reply; this version uses the standard library module socketserver to
do its work; socketserver provides TCPServer, ThreadingTCPServer, ForkingTCPServer,
UDP variants of these, and more, and routes each client connect request to a new
instance of a passed-in request handler object's handle method; socketserver also
supports Unix domain sockets, but only on Unixen; see the Python library manual.
