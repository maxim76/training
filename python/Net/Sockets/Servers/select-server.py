Server: handle multiple clients in parallel with select. use the select
module to manually multiplex among a set of sockets: main sockets which
accept new client connections, and input sockets connected to accepted
clients; select can take an optional 4th arg--0 to poll, n.m to wait n.m
seconds, or omitted to wait till any socket is ready for processing.
